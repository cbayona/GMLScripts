## Help a brother out

If you're feeling extremely generous, check out my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dysfunctionl).

If not, at least try to understand how the code works rather than just CP it into your game!

## Contributions

If you have a few scripts or projects that may be of use to someone else, feel free to make contributions! Suggestions, bug reports and pull requests are welcome. I'll have a ganders and make sure it's high enough quality (unlike the marketplace...)
